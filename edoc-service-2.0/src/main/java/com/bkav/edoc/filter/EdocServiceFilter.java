     * <li>Optionally wrap the response object with a custom implementation to
     * filter content or headers for output filtering
     * <li>

     * using the FilterChain object
     * (<code>chain.doFilter()</code>),
     * <li><strong>or</strong> not pass on the request/response pair to
     * the next entity in the filter chain to
     * block the request processing
     * </ul>
     * <li>Directly set headers on the response after invocation of the
